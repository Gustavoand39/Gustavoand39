<div align="center">I graduated with a degree in Computer Systems Engineering, with a focus on FullStack web development. My primary technologies are React and Express, where I have developed most of my expertise. Currently, I am broadening my knowledge to enhance my FullStack skillset by exploring new technologies and frameworks. My goal is to gain a more comprehensive understanding of both frontend and backend development to stay current in the field and continuously improve my versatility as a developer.</div>
